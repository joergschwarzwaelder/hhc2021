# Holiday Eggs

### Calling Birds
https://americanornithology.org/four-calling-birds/ establishes a link to the name of this year's HolidayHack Challenge (Calling Birds) and also to the past two: Turtle Doves and French Hens.  So I assume next year we will se KringleCon V: Golden Rings :)

### Frost Tower Wifi
The MAC address of the Wifi dongle is 02:4A:46:68:69:21 which is "<sub>STX</sub>JFhi!"

### Frost Tower Roof
Numby Chilblain says "Klatu Barada Nikto!" which is a citation from the film [The Day the Earth Stood Still](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still).

### Jack Frost <-> Donald Trump
Jack Frost talks a lot like Donald Trump. This fits to my last year's submission of Frosty's Toolbox which had the functions "Make Jack Nice Again" and "Make Jack Naughty Again" to change the blockchain.

### Where is the World is Caramel Santaigo
This is similar to the game "[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego?_%281985_video_game%29)" from 1985.

### Shenanigans Area
There is a hidden, Terry Pratchett's Discworld themed, Shenanigans area, which can only be reached by faking a teleportation to `shenanigans`:
